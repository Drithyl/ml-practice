# Machine Learning Exercises

This repository contains a filled Jupyter Notebook file with a series of Machine Learning exercises from my Computer Science degree (University of London). All code inside of it is mine and was submitted to a midterm evaluation.

The file `requirements.txt` contains all the modules required to run the Jupyter Notebook. Pip can be used to install them with the `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt` command.
