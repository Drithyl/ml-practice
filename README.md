# Machine Learning Exercises

This repository contains a filled Jupyter Notebook file with a series of Machine Learning exercises from my Computer Science degree (University of London). All code inside of it is mine and was submitted to a midterm evaluation.

The file `requirements.txt` contains all the modules required to run the Jupyter Notebook. Pip can be used to install them with the `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt` command.

## Exercises

Below are the several exercises that are resolved in the notebook:

1. Exploratory data analysis: visualizing part of the data of the Wine dataset (from the sklearn module), both clean and under noisy conditions.
2. Implementing a k-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm: defining a function that performs k-NN given a dataset.
3. Classifier evaluation: implement code for the evaluation of a classifier, with confusion matrices and common metrics like accuracy.
4. Nested cross-validation: using the k-NN implementation above, write code to perform n-fold nested cross-validation.
5. Summary of results: fill the provided tables with a summary of the results of the above code on a dataset.
